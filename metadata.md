 Data analytics researchers like to focus on new engines and algorithms. But most data analytics organizations 
 have a different and more fundamental problem: their analysts operate in a desperately information-poor environment. We are missing so much rich contextual metadata in our projects: what data we have, why we have it, how and by whom it gets used, and how all these aspects evolve over time. One problem is that we haven't been capturing and recording this information. A second is that we have yet to apply data science to the behavior of data scientists. It is time to get serious about capturing, recording, and analyzing the work people do with data and computation and the contextual human knowledge they bring to those tasks. This *data context* problem raises interesting systems challenges while also suggesting  opportunities for new applications and algorithms to significantly improve the efficiency of data analysts.

## Reading lists:

### Google Goods [?Student Presenters?]
1. *Halevy, Korn, Noy, et al.*  [**Goods: Organizing Googleâ€™s Datasets.**](http://sure) In SIGMOD 2016.


### Ground [?Student Presenters?]
1. *Hellerstein, Sreekanti, Gonzalez, et al.* 2016. [**Establishing Common Ground with Data Context**](under submission).


### Questions:

1. How do Ground and Goods differ in goals and design? Can either one grow up to serve the goals of the other or are they fundamentally divergent?
