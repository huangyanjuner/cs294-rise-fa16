This lecture will provide an overview of machine learning techniques for decision making and control.  In particular, we will focus on bandit and reinforcement learning techniques.  We will be reading from the updated textbook of [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (Second Edition)](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/bookdraft2016sep.pdf) by Sutton and Barto (available online in PDF form). I would encourage everyone to read the first chapter.

## Required Readings:

* **Chapter 2:** provides an overview of Multi-armed Bandits [Presented By Lynn]
* **Chapter 3:** provides and overview of Markov decision processes [Presented by Karen]
* **Chapter 6:** introduces TD learning and combines dynamic programming methods (Chapter 4) and MCMC methods (Chapter 5) for learning to control and is one of the fundamental methods in reinforcement learning. [Presented By Richard]

While much of the focus of machine learning research is on the process of training models (i.e., learning) there are a unique set of challenges around the process of serving and updating those models that is often overlooked.
In this lecture we will explore the bigger machine learning life-cycle and discuss the challenges around serving predictions.

### Questions:

1. What differentiates serving machine learning models from standard data serving?

1. Name one way in which algorithmic advances simplify model serving and one way in which they add additional challenges. -->
