While much of the focus of machine learning research is on the process of training models (i.e., learning) there are a unique set of challenges around the process of serving and updating those models that is often overlooked.
In this lecture we will explore the bigger machine learning life-cycle and discuss the challenges around serving predictions.

### Questions:

1. What differentiates serving machine learning models from standard data serving?

1. Name one way in which algorithmic advances simplify model serving and one way in which they add additional challenges.
