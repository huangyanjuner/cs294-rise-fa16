In this lecture, we discuss how we can use SGX to secure distributed systems such as MapReduce (as in the VC3 system): the cloud performs the MapReduce computations without seeing the data or being able to tamper with the computation. Then, we will discuss various types of leakage in SGX and approaches (such as ORAM and GhostRider) to address these issues.

While much of the focus of machine learning research is on the process of training models (i.e., learning) there are a unique set of challenges around the process of serving and updating those models that is often overlooked.
In this lecture we will explore the bigger machine learning life-cycle and discuss the challenges around serving predictions.

1. Name one way in which algorithmic advances simplify model serving and one way in which they add additional challenges.
