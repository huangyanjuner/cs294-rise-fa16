Today we have Moritz Hardt who will be giving a guest lecture on his work in robust machine learning.

## New Tools for Reliable Data Science

Most applications of machine learning across science and industry rely
on the holdout method for model selection and validation.
Unfortunately, the holdout method can fail in the now common situation
where the data scientist works interactively with the data,
iteratively choosing which methods to use by probing the same holdout
data many times.

In this lecture, I will review classical methods for model selection
and contrast them with some more recent advances in the field. In particular,
I will describe a framework for designing reliable machine learning benchmarks,
data science competitions, and hyperparameter tuning.
