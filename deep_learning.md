This lecture will cover an overview of developments in deep learning and then we will dive into several recent papers on developments in deep learning related to model compression, time-series modeling, as well as serving deep models.

Content to be added soon!

<!--
While much of the focus of machine learning research is on the process of training models (i.e., learning) there are a unique set of challenges around the process of serving and updating those models that is often overlooked.
In this lecture we will explore the bigger machine learning life-cycle and discuss the challenges around serving predictions.

### Questions:

1. What differentiates serving machine learning models from standard data serving?

1. Name one way in which algorithmic advances simplify model serving and one way in which they add additional challenges. -->
